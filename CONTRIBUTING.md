- Mention the version of .NET (8.0), OS, and any other relevant environment details.

### Suggesting Features

We are always looking for new ideas to improve the project. To suggest a feature:

- If not, create a new issue with a detailed description of the proposed feature.
- Explain the problem your feature would solve and possible implementations.

### Improving Documentation

We welcome improvements to our documentation! You can help by:

- Fixing typos or grammatical errors.
- Expanding explanations or adding new sections where clarification is needed.
- Updating out-of-date content as the project evolves.

### Code Contributions

For code changes or feature additions:

1. Create a branch following the [Branching Strategy](#branching-strategy-and-branch-protection).
2. Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
3. Follow the [coding conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions).
4. Add unit tests for any new functionality or fix existing failing tests.

## Branching Strategy and Branch Protection

### Master Branch (`master`)

The `master` branch contains the stable, production-ready code. No one can directly push to `master`. All changes must be done via pull requests (PRs) and require code review approval before merging.

### Development Branch (`develop`)

The `develop` branch is where active development takes place. Contributors should branch off from `develop` and open PRs to merge changes back into `develop`.

### Branch Protection Rules

1. **No direct commits** are allowed to the `master` or `develop` branches.
2. **All PRs** must pass the following checks before merging:
   - CI build (via GitHub Actions)
   - Code review by at least one maintainer
   - Unit tests pass (Optional)
   - Feature branches should be up-to-date with `develop` before merging
3. **Require signed commits** for any branch.
4. **No force pushes** or reverts are allowed on `master` or `develop` without approval from the maintainers.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your branch is up-to-date** with the latest changes from `develop`.
2. Submit a pull request to merge your feature branch into `develop`.
3. Clearly describe what the PR does and reference any related issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
4. Wait for code review and make changes if requested.
5. Once all checks pass and reviews are approved, a maintainer will merge the PR.

### PR Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style and structure.
- Limit each PR to one feature or bug fix. If you have multiple changes, submit separate PRs.
- Write meaningful commit messages explaining the changes in detail.
